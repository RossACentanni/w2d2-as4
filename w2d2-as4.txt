-RxJava is an implementation of a library for designing async/eventbased programs called ReactiveX.
-Reactive programming is a paradigm all about programming with asynchronous data. Ideally, you can create datastreams from literally anything,
 listen to them, and react appropriately. In addition, there should be a library of functions for interacting with the streams, such as combining or
 filtering. 
-RxJava adds a class called Observable to the Observer pattern. Any object that implements the Observer class is automatically subscribed to an object
 of the observable class. The subscriber then reacts to anything the Observable object puts out.
